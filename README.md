# Purva Jayani — Portfolio Website  
A personal portfolio built and hosted with Vercel at [https://project-1-portfolio-web-design.vercel.app/](https://project-1-portfolio-web-design.vercel.app/)

## Project Description  
I’m Purva, a software & data engineering student at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), based in Newark, New Jersey. I build web experiences that are reliable, well-tested, and user-centric, and I also design and engineer physical projects.  
This portfolio site showcases:  
- My introduction and background (“Welcome to my Portfolio. I'm Purva.”)  
- Projects I’ve worked on — for example:  
  - *Weather Reporter* — uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.  
  - *Currency Exchange Rate Tracker* — built with React / Vite, uses the OpenExchangeRates API with live updates.  
  - *Wrench Multi-purpose Spanner Keychain* — a physical design project combining 3D printing & laser cutting.  
- My skills section (Python, CAD software, 3 D design & modeling, etc).  
- Contact form and details (email: paj6@njit.edu) and location.
